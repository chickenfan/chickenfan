I like to programme in c/c++ and JVM languages

Anyway just a bit more about myself:

- I have been programming for like 4-5 years and started with C# which I for some reason do not like although I know about a lot of the advantages to it over jvm languages.
- My favourite programming language rn is probably C++ with probably scala or java coming in 2nd.
- I started programming to make unity games which I have tried and dislike for no apparent reason.
- I learnt C++ probably bcs of Unreal Engine or CryEngine, idr the reason.
